  Towards the end of April 2023, after 4 months in orbit, the ispace Mission 1 will put the Emirates Lunar Rover (nickname Rashid) on the Moon. On board the rover is a Langmuir probe system developed and build by Eidsvoll Electronics in close cooperation with members from the 4DSpace Research Group. During the 14 days surface operations following touchdown, 4DSPace member Lasse Clausen will help command the rover from mission control center in Dubai, hopefully making unprecedented measurements of the lunar plasma environment.
