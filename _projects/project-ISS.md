   The multi-needle Langmuir probe, designed and build by a cooperation of Eidsvoll Electronics and the 4DSpace Research Group, will be one of the first instruments on board the new Bartolomeo payload system outside the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). From there, it will provide insights into the electrodynamics of the equatorial ionosphere, probing plasma bubbles and blobs, helping to understand the causes for satellite signal disturbances.
