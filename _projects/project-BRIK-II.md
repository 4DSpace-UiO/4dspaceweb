title: BRIK-II

description: |
  In summer 2021 Virgin Orbit launched the dutch satellite BRIK-II into orbit around Earth. The satellite carries a multi-needle Langmuir probe capable at resolving ionospheric plasma densities at very high resolution. Together with dutch colleagues, members of the 4DSpace Research Group are now investigating how to use BRIK-II data to further improve our understanding of ionospheric signal disturbances.
