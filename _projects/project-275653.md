title: 4DSpace investigation of plasma turbulence in the cusp ionosphere
subtitle: Project Period: 2018 - 2022
description: |
  Cycle slips in GPS receivers frequently occur due to plasma density irregularities at high latitudes, even during solar minimum conditions. Recent observations have revealed that cusp auroral dynamics significantly amplify radio signal disturbances. The primary objective for this project is to explore the physical properties of the auroral cusp. In this project we are going to develop a 3D in-situ measurement technique for the Investigation of Cusp Irregularities (ICI) rocket program. Utilizing the miniaturized multi-Needle Langmuir probe system, we are going to instrument 12 ice-hockey puck sized daughter payloads to achieve multi-point measurements. The mini-payloads will be released 4 by 4, in two perpendicular directions, and travel at ~8 m/s relative to the main rocket body, to configure three squares around the rocket. During the flight we expect a final separation between the sub-payloads and the rocket of about 2.5 km and the largest separation between sub-payloads will be about 5 km. This innovative experiment will enable us to explore the 3D nature of turbulent structures. ICI-5 was launched from Ny-Ålesund in December 2019. We will use all available ground instruments, including EISCAT Svalbard Radar, the Longearbyen SuperDARN radar, and auroral instruments at the Kjell Henriksen Observatory, to precisely determine the optimal launch condition. ICI-5 was be part of the Grand Challenge Initiative Cusp rocket program, currently consisting of 10 rockets. This is an historic opportunity and our project is very timely. UiO has flown the novel 4-NLP system onboard 3 NASA rockets. We also flew it on the CAPER-2 payload from Andøya over Svalbard and will fly it on the JAXA rocket from Svalbard in January 2022. Information gathered by all rockets and the ground instruments will provide critical information about the drivers for the plasma turbulence.

The solar wind gives rise to a strong turbulence on the top side of the polar atmosphere. This leads to interference in radio signals propagating through it. Solar storms may give rise to disturbances blocking navigation and communication systems. With regard to safety in the Arctic, it would be essential to forecast periods and regions of the GPS failure. However, in order to develop space weather forecast models, we need to understand the underlying physics. We are in demand of high resolution measurement data in order to test alternative models in the literature, and we have to perform these measurements with in-situ instruments.

 4DSpace is a part of the international Grand Challenge Initiative - Cusp (GCI-Cusp). GCI-Cusp is a giant collaboration project, that umbrellas 12 rockets (one Japanese, ten American, and one Norwegian). "Cusp" is the scientific term for the energy funnel from the solar wind down to the Earth's atmosphere. Every day Svalbard lies under this energy funnel for several hours. Hence, Svalbard is a window towards space. The daytime aurora above Svalbard visualizes the footpoint of the cusp. UiO flies scientific instrument on six of the 12 GCI-Cusp rockets. Five of these have already been flown through the daytime auroras above Svalbard. We are now preparing the data for scientific use. The data will be made available through SIOS (Svalbard Integrated Earth Observing System). A new sounding rocket with our instruments will be launched in November 2021 from Ny Ålesund on Svalbard.

 The main efforts in the 4DSpace project are directed towards the Norwegian rocket experiment, for which we have developed 3D experiment to investigate plasma turbulence. We have carried out two technical tests of the 4DSpace module which houses 6 daughter payloads. First time on the Nucleous rocket by Nammo Raufoss in September 2018, and the second time on the student rocket G-CHASER in January 2019, both from Andøya. The rocket is equipped with two such 4DSpace modules, i.e. 12 daughters to be released from the rocket, with the goal to obtain 3D measurements of turbulence. This has never been done before - high risk high gain. We are now preparing a robust system for future rockets.
