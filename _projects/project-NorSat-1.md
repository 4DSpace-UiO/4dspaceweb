The Norwegian satellite NorSat-1 carries the first multi-needle Langmuir probe in orbit around Earth. Capable of measuring the plasma density 1000 times per second, NorSat-1 helps providing insights into the dynamics of the high-latitude ionosphere. Launched in 2017, the m-NLP build by members of the 4DSpace Research Group continues to provide high-quality data, showing no sign of giving up soon.
