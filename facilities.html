    <h2>Multi-Needle Langmuir Probes (MNLP)</h2>
    <p>
    Multi-Needle Langmuir Probes (MNLP) measure electron density in plasma on various space probes, e.g. on the ICI rocket series.

    <h2>Plasma Chamber</h2>
    <p>
        For testing of new plasma instruments the 4DSpace Research Group operates the "Space Simulation Chamber" (SSC). In this 4 500 l tank, space instrumentation experiences ionospheric plasma conditions similar to those on low-Earth orbit (LEO). The streaming plasma is generated by a RF plasma device from ThrustMe. The SSC is equipped with an array of diagnostic devices, as well as a set of linear drives from igus that allow the operator to move equipment within the tank while plasma is being generated.
