        <b>4DSpace</b> offers student education in space science and technology at all levels. Space science is highly interdisciplinary, and methods, tools and approach can also be applied to many other fields of science. Projects are often carried out within international collaboration. Here you will find examples of study opportunities. If you are a bachelor or master students you will find the list of relevant activities in corresponding articles.
