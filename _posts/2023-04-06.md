MISSION UPDATE FROM ISPACE: “Our M1 lander remains in a stable orbit around the Moon. As Ground Controllers, we work to maintain communication with the lander and prepare for tasks and events such as Moon occultations, which is when the Moon comes between the Earth and the lander. This means we’re unable to talk to the lander for a period of time, so it’s our job to ensure all equipment is working correctly, allowing the lander to automatically function during communication link downtimes.” — Alex Einbinder & Ponglert Rattanachinalai: Ground Controllers
